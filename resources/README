There are three resource trees under this directory.  Each of the subdirectories
found here is treated as the root of a resource tree in certain situations:

builtin/
   This is a set of all the resources required by the built-in user interface
   (button graphics, sound effects) as well as the built-in levels and level
   editor projects (robot and background graphics).  Note that the built-in
   level config file itself is not in this resource tree.

default/
   Contains the built-in levels that you get when starting the game itself.
   As of this writing, the level config file (at ROBO-INF/default.map) is the
   only resource in this collection.  All other resources are expected to be
   provided by builtin_resources.

new_project/
   Contains the resources given to a newly-created level editor project.  As
   of this writing, the only resource in here is a ROBO-INF/default.map which
   relies on the resources found in the builtin_resources collection. Authors
   of individual level packs can override any or all of the default resources
   by including their own resources with the same paths in their level pack.
