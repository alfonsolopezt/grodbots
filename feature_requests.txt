Game Features:
-Put in the number of steps counter on the play field
-Load a "ghost" robot and circuit so you can compare solutions
-Make loading levels and circuits more fault-tolerant and provide specific error messages
-Score keeping (based on squares worth certain point values)
-Goodies to pick up along the way or numbered checkpoints
-Batteries
-Be able to specify how many circuit evaluations per step in a level
-Random gate delays in "hard" mode?
-Different floor textures that the robot can detect (metal, carpet, dirt, tile, ...)

Images:
-Smaller robot sprite and/or larger tiles?
-Start/Pause/Single Step/Reset buttons
-Images for different floor textures

Sounds:
-When game is running
 -AND/OR/NOT gate goes on/off
 -robot steps up/down/left/right
 -robot is confused about which direction to step
-Circuit Editor
 -"you suck" sound (for trying to delete undeletable stuff)
 -entering a connectable region while dragging a wire
 -exiting a connectable region while dragging a wire
 -removing a wire
 -deleting all gates at once (clearing the circuit out)
-music for circuit editor and running game
-little ditties for the beginning of each level (maybe this would be better suited to the MIDI sequencer api)
 
Completed:
-Use files to load and save circuits
-Fix single-step
-Clear old gates when loading circuit
-Button for clearing circuit editor
-Fix the "You Win!!" message (incl. when single-stepping into the cake)
-Fix reset when game is running
-another reworking of the start/pause/step/reset UI
-Single-step button for debugging (and redo interface with Start/Pause/Single Step/Reset)
-Lock circuit editor when game is running (unlock after reset)
-Be able to load new levels from a chosen file
-Multi-frame robot sprite
